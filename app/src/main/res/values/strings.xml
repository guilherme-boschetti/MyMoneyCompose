    <string name="about_text">This is an application to do financial management.\n
\nControlling monthly expenses can be a difficult task for many people. Many of them do not keep track of their spending, and sometimes end up being negative for spending more than they could. Other people keep track of their expenses by writing it down, whether in a notebook, diary or even a notepad, and use the help of a calculator to calculate their expenses and/or their balance for the month.\n
\nThese expenses can be of varied types, such as purchases at the market, household bills such as water, electricity, telephone, gas, installments for purchases of clothes or household items, healthcare expenses, medicines, study expenses, school supplies, vehicle expenses, there are a multitude of possible types of expenses that people have every month, and many of these people have difficulty keeping track of their expenses.\n
\nOne of the problems suffered by people who write down their expenses on paper is that not whenever they make a purchase, or pay for some bill or expense, they have their paper and pen at hand to make their notes, and later they end up forgetting to write it down, and as a result, they end up not having an efficient control of their expenses.\n
\nIn this context, this application aims to help people to control their expenses.\n
\nIt is possible to inform expenses, of the most diverse types, to control everything that is spent in the month. It is also possible to report earnings. The application adds up earnings and expenses and displays the balance for the month.</string>
